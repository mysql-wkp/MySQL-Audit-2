   After MySQL 5.7 installed, the another one should be done. That's MySQL audit plugin, which is different from audit_log plugin. 
Audit_log plugin is inherited from Percona. We port the source code from Percona to MySQL 5.7, and it will be compiled when MySQL 5.7
be compiled. 
   But, on the other sides, MySQL audit plugin is inherited from McAfee. It's a independent one.Therefore, the compilation 
and installation is apart from MySQL 5.7 COMPILATION and INSTALLATION. here is the guidline of how to compile and install the MYSQL audit
plugin. 


PREREQUISITE:
Before install the mysql-audit-sql plugin, you need to install mysql properly. After correct installation, the some libs will be used in next installation.

how to build the mcafee/qiyi plugin:

(0) At first, runing the bootstrap.sh script. if it has not the permission to excute, then run 'chmod +x bootstrap.sh'. 
./bootstrap.sh

(1) then set some environment variables for gcc. 

CXX='gcc -static-libgcc' CC='gcc -static-libgcc'

(2) to configure it. run the following scripts. Note: the prefix: --with-mysql and --with-mysql-installdir is mandatory. --with-mysql-installdir is used for
next compilation step.

./configure --with-mysql=/the_mysql_source_directory --with-mysql-libservices=/the_mysql_source_directory_install_dir/libservices/libmysqlservices.a --with-mysql-installdir=/the_mysql_source_directory_install_dir

Taken mine as an instance. on my computer, i will run the command as following:

CXX='gcc -static-libgcc' CC='gcc -static-libgcc' ./configure --with-mysql=/home/homli/work/mysql-server/ --with-mysql-libservices=/home/homli/work/mysql-server/build_cmk/libservices/libmysqlservices.a --with-mysql-plugindir=/home/homli/work/mysql-server/build_cmk/bin/lib/plugin --with-mysql-installdir=/home/homli/work/mysql-server/build_cmk/

(3)  then run the following script to make and install the audit plugin.

make && make install

(4) If you meet some errors, it's okay and be patient to fix it on you own. 

(5) At last, Maybe enjoy the DIY.
