in this folder, some python scripts are created to mainuplate database operation. and restful api to connect with cmdb.

database config params are read from 'mysql.cnf', the new sections and items are allowed added as your will. 

in order to usy file name as 'xxx.xxx.xxx', a symbol link file are created with '.py' as its extension.

mysql.cnf is db configuration file for db connection. when configurations changed, you should apply the changes in conn/mysql.cnf, not this mysql.cnf file.
